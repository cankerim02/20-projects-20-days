 # 20 Projects in 20 Days - HTML/CSS and JavaScript



 ##### Description:

 I will work on mini-projects using the HTML, CSS, JS languages every day. Sometimes, I will also make improvements by utilizing other people's code.

 - ###### I believe that at the end of 20 days, there will be significant progress here.
